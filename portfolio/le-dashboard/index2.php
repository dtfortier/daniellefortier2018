                    <h3>Increase Customer Engagement</h3>
                    <p>The customer dashboard, formerly known as the "Launchpad", was a data tool that suffered from a severe lack of customer engagement. It was difficult to use and didn't display data in a way that customers might find appealing. The idea was to make data look interesting, and to design an environment that would be easier to navigate, enticing users to login to their dashboard more.</p>
                    <p>Another challenge was incorporating data and the graphs from a separate business intelligence software that Localedge is using to manage reporting data, which meant we were limited on style for any graphs shown in the dashboard. We were able to work around that style block to the best of our abilities, and we continue to research new ways to stretch customization to ensure we keep up to date on a modern look and feel.</p>

                    <h3>How We Got There</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge I faced throughout this project was balancing moving forward with designs, while collaborating with the product specialists and developers. Since this project touched every part of Localedge's products, I needed to coordinate and get buy‐in from many teams. This was tough. </p> 
                    <p>Managing feedback was even more challenging because viewpoints were overall quite diverse. The team spent a heavy amount of time debating design decisions — when there wasn’t always data that could easily be gathered to help drive a decision.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, because we were incorporating some old technology into the new dashboard as well as the seperate reporting data software, some design decisions were made that were not ideal. Much of the process became, "how far can we stretch this design concept with the foundation we already have built?" This eventually caused for some inconsistent design solutions throughout the application and thus caused for many failed tickets on the Quality Assurance end. </p>

                <h4>The Portal</h4>
                    <p>I realized this pattern a few legs into the project and invested time into creating documentation to help alleviate the technology pains, and better articulate and illustrate the overall design concept and standards to follow.</p>
                    <p>I developed a <a href="http://uxui.localedge.com">UX/UI Portal</a>. This includes sections for mockups, prototypes and the ui standards. It is a constant work in progress, however it has helped us to set rules for certain items and use them towards new design and development plans, company wide.</p>

                            <p>Localedge's customer dashboard design was severly out of date, in 2014. My job was to take an old design and modernize the interface and the user experience up to modern standards. Key pieces to my design concept were a side navigation to access an excessive list of internal links, tabbed individual reporting navigation for each application element, and an overall clean and consistant look and feel. The image above is just a basic example of what most of the reporting pages look like. </p>

                            <p>With the redesign of the new Localedge customer dashboard, I felt there needed to be a new standards site of set design rules. This is still a work in progress. This site has been a true learning experience in my development as a UX/UI Designer as I was able to take ownership over ensuring these rules are followed and are communicated well to Product Owners and Developers. Setting design rules for a large application has been both challenging and rewarding. </p>
